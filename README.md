# Computer-Graphics-From-Scratch
It feels like CS undergrad would feel incomplete if I don't do some work on RAW computer graphics related task. Thus, this repo.

I will be following this book: [Computer Graphics From Scratch](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/)

Some good resources:
- [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
- [Vulkan Tutorial (Rust)](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/introduction.html)

Rust:
- [Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
